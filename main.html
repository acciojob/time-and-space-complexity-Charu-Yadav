	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>

  <p>
  Time complexity in algorithms refers to how the execution time of an algorithm scales with the size of the input. Efficient algorithms have lower time complexity, meaning they take less time to run as input size increases.
  </p>

  <p>
  <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory used by an algorithm as a function of the input size. For example, an array of size n requires O(n) space. Understanding space complexity is essential for writing optimized programs.
