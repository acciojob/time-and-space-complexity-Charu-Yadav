	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>

  <p>
  Time complexity in algorithms refers to how the execution time of an algorithm scales with the size of the input. Efficient time complexity means the algorithm requires less time to execute, especially with larger inputs.
  </p>

  <p>
  <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory used by an algorithm as a function of the input size. For example, an array of size n requires O(n) space.
